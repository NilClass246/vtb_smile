Happy birthday, congratulations! This the third birthday of Miss Mea since I know you. How time flies...At the beginning, it's just the whirlwind-like style you brought made me curious, and I'm attracted, then I started to pay attention to your livestreams and performances, but it didn't stop there. Miss Mea's various attractive features, all kinds of lovely traits,  these naturally expressed characteristics, have gradually become indispensable necessities in my daily life. Now in the third year, I'm really flattered to receive such an invitation, and I'm really grateful. However, in order to better participate in subsequent activities as Mea's wallet, I finally reluctantly gave up this aopportunity...I hope that the generous Miss Mea could forgive me for my rudeness. I'm really sorry!\nFinally, I wish Miss Mea a happy birthday again! May the subsequent activities continue happily!\n\nSeaside\nAug.2,2021"
