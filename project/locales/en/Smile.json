    "opening_3":"She wanted to leave, but it's impossible, as all the exits of the town have been blocked, even the gate she came through was shut as powerless, and its too heavy for her to push.",
    "opening_4":"She tried switching on the brake, but there's no responce, it seems power here is failed. The only good thing is that she found some generators when looking for other exits, they're old, but seems to be useful. ",
    "opening_5":"The sun is completely set, only several meters range is visual. Suddenly, sound like laughter of a woman come from the other end of the town. The wild laughter along with wind pierced her eardrum, resounded in her brain.",
    "opening_6":"All of a shock, Mea knocked down the pile of rubbish alongside the street. Rubbish floods with brown sewage and smell of the rotten, blocked half of the way.",
    "opening_7":"Mea pulled her foot pressed under junk after some time of shock. She walked away, leaving a trail of footprints. Feeling terrified, she'd just like to find out the generator and leave.",
    "opening_8":"But soon she comes back. What she found is a footprint, with opposite direction towards those her left and still not faded.",
    "opening_9":"\"Is this carelessly stepped by me?\"\nShe stopped thinking, hasten away to find those generators, the final hope, maybe.",
